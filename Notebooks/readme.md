The notebook works with Google Colab and requires the installaiton of [`Phiflow`](https://github.com/tum-pbs/PhiFlow). The high-resolution training dataset (27.5 GB, approx.) is available at [`Link here`](). The DPNN-based model has been trained using 50 unique experiments (downsampled by 3x). The testing (or inference) is performed on the downsampled testing dataset. The high-resolution testing dataset (82.5 GB, approx.) is available at [`Link here`](). 

This Jupyter Notebook is a working demonstration of the DPNN based-model for spatio-temporal predictions of velocity flowfields and associated quantities for 1 representative testing experiment. This representative dataset is part of the testing dataset using in this study [`Preptint`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04296) and is easily downloadable. All associate function and sobroutines have been included that were used to generate the results (atleast majority) in this study. Please refer to markDown comments in the notebook for further details.
